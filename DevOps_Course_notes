Waterfall Model ( Traditional Sofware Development Approaches)
The model is called waterfall because it progresses downward direction.
- Requirement Analysis
- System Design
- Implementation
- Testing
- Deployment
- maintenance

**SWOT (++Advantages)**
- Easy to use 
- Cost Effective
- Time saving
- Easy testing
- Suitable for small projects
- Managerial Control


* Disadvantages**
- Risky and Uncertain
- Not suitable for complex projects
- Final product avaible only at the end
- Not suitable for projects with changing requirements
- Difficult to change in the testing phase.

Agile Model
This model focuses on process adobtability anf customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of working software product.
Build > Design > Plan > Analyze > Review > Launch 

Product Backlog > Sprint Planning > Sprit Backlog
Scrum Team & Daily Scrums  > Sprint Review 

**SWOT (++Advantages)**
- Dynamic Response to requirement
- Cost effective
- Superior quality product 
- Direct communication between stakeholder
- Best suited for large and long term projects.
- Minimunm resource requirement

** Disadvantages**

Testing Tools
>> TestNg, Junit, Selenium etc.
These tools enable QA's to properly test tultiple code bases in tandem to ensure that the functioning is faultness.

QA - Quality Assurance
Develops test plans to test new and exiting software. 

Test NG > Generate Reports.
